# Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning classification algorithms. Customer churn means when a customer stops using a company’s services. Predicting churn helps businesses take action to retain customers.

## Dataset
The dataset used is Telco Customer Churn, which includes customer information such as:
- Gender  
- Tenure  
- Monthly Charges  
- Contract Type  
- Payment Method  
- Churn (Yes/No)

## Objective
To build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a customer will leave the company.

## Steps Performed
1. Data loading and understanding  
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Feature encoding and scaling  
5. Model training  
6. Model evaluation  

## Machine Learning Models Used
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

## Result
The trained model predicts whether a customer will churn or not based on input features.
